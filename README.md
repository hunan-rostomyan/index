Offline indexing for documentation to make it searchable.


### Indexing

1. Clone this repository
2. Clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry/docs-bosh (leave the name `docs-bosh`)
3. `cd python`
4. `make` (assumes you have `python3` installed)

This will index the documentation, creating `index_*.json` files in the current directory.


### Searching

Now that we have the indexes, we can feed it into a search engine to test things out. Let's copy the indexes into a place where the web app can find it.

```bash
$ make sync
```

Now that the data is copied, we prepare and launch the web app. First, we setup the python libraries needed to run the app:

* `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Next we need to configure some essential variables for the app:

* `source dev_variables` (if you type `echo $DOCS_URL` and get nothing, something went wrong)

We're now ready to launch the app:

```bash
$ make run
```

If you get an error about ports, edit *Makefile* and change `8001` to something else. If all went well, you should now navigate to [http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001) to play with the search engine.

Currently two types of search are possible:

1. search/title/[query]
2. search/content/[query]

As the names suggest, the first matches documents based on title, the second based on the entire contents.
